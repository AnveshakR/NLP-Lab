Syntactic parsing is a technique by which segmented, tokenized, and part-of-speech tagged
text is assigned a structure that reveals the relationships between tokens governed by syntax
rules, e.g. by grammars. Consider the sentence:
The factory employs 12.8 percent of Bradford County.
A syntax parse produces a tree that might help us understand that the subject of the sentence
is “the factory”, the predicate is “employs”, and the target is “12.8 percent”, which in turn is
modified by “Bradford County.” Syntax parses are often a first step toward deep information
extraction or semantic understanding of text.
